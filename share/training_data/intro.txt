Mettalex: The Future of Decentralized Trading
Mettalex started as a decentralized commodities exchange on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Ethereum (ETH) under the Fetch.ai umbrella. Since then it has become an independent project with its own dedicated team, though it still enjoys some support from Fetch.ai. This is an exciting time for Mettalex as it builds towards launch on the Fetch.ai Mainnet. Launching on Fetch.ai requires a rebuild which will include brand-new functionalities like agent-based trading.

Mettalex will be integrating new agent-based trading technology developed by Fetch.ai. The technology leverages intelligent agent interactions to optimize DeFi trade execution. AI agent integration will also address current concerns regarding central points of failure in smart contract-based DeFi protocols by favoring a true peer to peer connection. The decentralized and distributed nature of agent-based trading challenges the extent to which many DeFi exchanges are in fact practicing decentralization. With ai-based trading integration Mettalex expects to create a more robust and secure platform fit for the future.
